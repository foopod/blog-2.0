# 0. Summary

The aim of Mastering Coaching by Max Landsberg is to strengthen and stretch the horizontal bar of the Coaching T into areas I might have missed otherwise. It covers areas like sports, neuroscience, psychology and strategy.

# 1. Science

## 1.1. Neuroscience

### 1.1.1. The Core of the Human brain

1. *Prioritise Survival* - Whether it be a T-Rex or a stressful moment in the office, if the brain senses danger we can have knee jerk reactions ('amygdala hijack') and often do things without reason.

2. *Minimise Energy Use* - The brain uses a shit ton of energy (25% of it at rest), this is why we start to hardwire pathways in the brain to do certain tasks, these can also be called habits.

3. *Strengthen oft-used circuits* - This follows the same as above, the brain is constantly trying to create new patterns and optimise itself.

4. *Process one task at a time* - Contrary to popular human suck at multitasking, we just can't to it. We like things broken down into nice and small tasks and then tackle them sequentially. Things take longer and we make more mistakes when we are task switching.

### 1.1.2. Knowing how the brain operates and making strategies to deal with it.

+ *Spotting Threats*
  + Avoid making crucial decisions when highly anxious.
  + Label the situation and reframe it in another way.
  + Socialise the situation, consult peers, get advice/help.
  + Use Positive Psychology/Mindfulness.
  + Attend to Health.
+ *Make Schemas and correct errors*
  + Recognise that change takes time and effort.
  + Don't keep on telling someone to act different (might trigger their amygdala).
  + Include, Don't alienate.
  + Be consistent and trustable.
  + Chunk effectively (mental maps).
  + Use Visualization
+ *Gain Rewards* 
  + Check in on perceived fairness.
  + Be Consistent.
  + Appraise how you reward others.
+ *Create habits*
  + Examine you habit inventory.
  + Habits build stronger in a social environment.
+ *Code for emotions*
  + Use Emotion fluently and help others to do so too.
  + Consider role-playing or video feedback to grow skills.
+ *Find Focus*
  + Use mindfulness to acheive higher focus.
  + Employ the techniques of expert performance.
  
## 1.2. Sports Psychology

### 1.2.1. Controlling Anxiety

**Thought control strategies** include consciously blocking out distractions, explicitly putting things into perspective, positive thinking, affirmations and prayer.

**Task focus strategies** like narrowing focus to the point of tunnel vision and concentration on specific goals.

**Emotional control strategies** includes controlling arousal and can be done through listening to calming music.

**Behavioural Strategies** like changing or controlling the environment or following a set routine.

### 1.2.2. Visualizing Success

Visualizing tasks and actions trigger the same parts of the brain as if we were preparing for and undertaking those tasks, thus helping to strengten connections and develop neural pathways.

PETTLEP is a framework that helps with this. The more in depth the visualization the more effective it is.

+ *Physical* - The physical aspects of doing actions. If we look at speaking examples include tone of voice, gestures and eye contact.
+ *Environment* - Where the action will take place. Try going to the actual place, if not watch videos look at photos. Think about all the senses, not just sight, what can you hear? what smells are there here?
+ *Task* - Imagine walking throught the task as completely as possible, beginning to end with as much detail as possible.
+ *Timing* - It is important to put the pace of the visualisation to the pace of the performance.
+ *Learning* - Update the imagery frequently, after mastering a low-key presentation, try visualizing doing it at the UN.
+ *Emotion* - Match emotions to the journey of the task. Maybe you start out nervous, but get into the flow, have a good joke and laugh at it yourself, then the elatedness that comes with an applause.
+ *Perspective* - Try to look at the visualization from other angles, what is an audience member going to see.

### 1.2.3. Setting Goals

The right goals can really help to motivate people.

1. They focus attention.
2. Increasing effort and efficiency.
3. Building resilience and persistence in the face of adversity.
4. Promoting development of new strategies for problem solving.

It is also important to match the type of goal to the person and the strategy.

1. *Process Goals* - e.g. "Kicking the ball Y% harder"
2. *Performance Goals* - e.g. "X% better accuracy in goal shooting"
3. *Outcome Goals* - "Winning the World Cup"

It is hard to motivate people with Process Goals, and Outcome Goals may be what everyone wants, but they make it hard to recover from set backs and are difficult to measure progress.

### 1.2.4. Cycling Success

For 70 years before 1992, Britain had won no medals for cycling at the Olympics. But some key people changed that using the techniques below.

1. *Set a bold and precise vision.* Peter Keen announced at the Annual Conference that he wanted to make Britain the World's top Olympic cycling nation.
2. *Obsess over the marginal gains.* A 1% gain can make a difference, but if you find lots of places where you can makea 1% gain, they stack together. Dave Brailsford obsessed over everything the team was doing, not just training and nutrition. He analysed the pillows they used, set strict protocols for washing and researched gels to maximise the benefits of massage.
3. *Draw knowledge from far and wide.* Brailsford also drew on knowledge from Sports Science, Business Success and Data Analysis from Baseball.
4. *Know and nurture the team ethos.* This comes from alignment of the team, around goals, values and much more. The team together are in pursuit of excellence, they do this through being open minded and looking for innovation everywhere.

## 1.3. Positive Psychology

### 1.3.1. Seligman's PERMA for wellbeing

**Positivity** - Happy emotions are necessary for wellbeing, and they don't have to be fleeting. Look into learned optimism, REBT's ABCDE technique and resilience through a growth mindset.

**Engagement** - Being present and engaged in a task. Being in the flow can help, also mindfulness.

**Relationships** - Crucial for mental health. Things that help are emotional intelligence and appreciative inquiry.

**Meaning** - Life needs to have meaning, this can be broken up into purpose, values, efficacy and self-worth.

**Accomplishment** - Understanding how to work with hope and set clear goals is crucial.

### 1.3.2. ABCDE of Resilience

**A** - Activating event. The trigger or cause of the problem.

**B** - Belief. Any preconceived notions about the situation or the event.

**C** - Consequence. How you feel after the event.

**D** - Dispute. Take a moment to dispute your existing belief and reason with it. Look at it from another angle. What benefits do I get believing this? Is there an alternative belief? Is it really that bad? Is it within my control?

**E** - Effect. What is the of the dispute? Has your belief changed? Even if not do you feel better about the even now that you have looked at it differently.

### 1.3.3. Resilient Mindset

A growth mindset is much better for resilience than a fixed mindset. As described by Carol Dweck, a growth mindset allows people to learn continuously, be more flexible and persist in the face of setbacks.

### 1.3.4. Flow

Things need to get into a flow state include..

1. Having a clear goal, thus creating focus.
2. Getting clear and immediate feedback, whether it be external feedback (the stock market) or internal (painting a picture).
3. Balancing skill, the task at hand should not be too easy that it bores you or too difficult that you get stuck.

Others suggest that it is easier to get into a state of flow when you are invested in the outcome.

### 1.3.5. Tools for building positive relationships

*Best Possible Selft* - Imagine and write about the best possible imaginary relationships that you can have are and what steps you might need to realise them.

*Gratitude Letter* - Write a letter to someone about something awesome that they did, describe your feelings of gratitude. Maybe even share it with them.

*Forgiveness Letter* - Write about a hurtful event that occurred at least 1 year ago and write a letter to the offender to forgive them. Maybe even share it with them.

*Acts of kindness* - Perform three acts of kindness and write about them and their outcomes.

## 1.4. Mindfulness

The psychological state of calm awareness of the present moment. Mindfulness helps to reduce stress, think clearly, help focus and benefits overall wellbeing. Meditation is a common practice to promote mindfulness, but there are other techniques too.

## 1.5. Experiential Learning

The 70/20/10 describes how we learn. 70% is through doing (learning on the job), 20% is through other people (colleagues and mentors) and 10% is through written and formal training.

### 1.5.1. Dewey's Experiential learning model

experience concretely > observe and reflect > form abstract concepts > test implications of concepts

It is important to know that different people prefer individual steps and will linger in an area of comfort.

### 1.5.2. Learning Styles

Activists learn by doings. They like to be hands on and in the thick of it. The best ways for them to learn are brainstorming, problem-solving, group discussion, puzzles, competitions and role-play.

Theorists are the opposite. They are systematic in learning the theory behind eveything. They prefer to analyse and synthesize. The best ways for them to learn are models, statistics, stories, quotes, background information and applying theories.

Pragmatists need to see how learning can be put into action. Abstract ideas bounce off. The best ways for them to learn are problem-solving, case studies and discussion.

Reflectors like to watch, they learn by observing. The best ways for them to learn are paired discussions, self-analysis, questionnaires, time out, observing activities, feedback from others, coaching and interviews.

# 2. Strategies

## 2.1. Expert Performance

What is expert performance in your area? Defining what it looks like is an excellent way to set goals.

### 2.1.1 Schemata

Map the domain. Experts have templates that they use to represent their domain. These can be used to rapidly discern observations and can easily be applied in a number of different situations. Schemata make it easy to respond to quickly in certain situations. Imagine firefighting or nursing, the response is instant. But obviously this has pros and cons.

### 2.1.2. Chunking

To easier understand and store your domain you can break it down. It is really hard for humans to store large detailed processes and situations. It is found that experts have usually chunked information down into easy steps that can be put back together (not necessarily in the same order). This allows experts to identify meaningful patterns in the information and draw even further knowledge. It also makes it easier to identify these patterns if you can identify parts of them from predefined chunks.

### 2.1.3. Deliberate Practice

1. Clear intent and commitment - Make a goal, make a plan and stick to it.
2. Engagement in Stretch Activities - Beyond your comfort zone and not yet sustainable.
3. Close and Rigorous Monitoring - Have a coach, a video and a stopwatch.
4. Generation of Specific Feedback - To know how you are doing and what you can do to improve.

### 2.1.4. Surprise Practice

It may not always be possible to schedule practice, this is true of things like speaking in front of large crowds. It is important to maek the most of opportunities that arise and there are things you can do to seek these opportunities out.

## 2.2. Six Steps to Mastery

These steps were developed by Max Landsberg after researching the Old Masters painters.

The most important is Passion, then you also need Places, Prior Art, Productivity, Practice and Patrons.

### 2.2.1. Places

Travel can bring great benefits to ones experience. Go and see excellence in action, if you are a Developer go and visit Google. You can learn a lot from travel, find inspiration that you didn't anticipate and build a strong and international personal network.

### 2.2.2. Prior Art
