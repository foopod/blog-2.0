#Safety and Support

###Unlocking performance in a team.

Creating a environment where people can be autonomous and creative is essential. Many of us don't work in factories, we work in jobs where creative critical and innovative thinking are the key to success.

So what is a safe space? And why is it so important?

A safe space is free from bullying, free from personal judgement, it is a place where you can freely express yourself and your opinions without fear.

There are some common practices that help to destroy a persons personal safety, practices that are 'normal', but lock a person into a fixed mindset that sets them up for failure. These are things like leadership asking for everything rather than having a distinct strategic focus, having the wrong people set the KPIs and bullying.

### Lack of Prioritisation

This is commonly seen or experienced as when a business is more reactive than strategic. When this happens the priority of work changes nearly on a daily basis and while I'm sure some teams that can handle this, an entire business cannot. This may also presents itself in siloed businesses when different business units have differing priorities and pull rank regularly to make work move through the pipeline. This often leads to a JFDI attitude and more pressure, more stress, less focus and poor decision making.

But when this

### Governance vs. Support

When I see senior leaders talking about Agile they always question governance. How can they ensure success by giving their people autonomy?

Is it because we are all cowboys and cowgirls at heart? 

Nope. But how often do we talk about Agile leadership? How does a leader (not Product Owner) have influence over their business. This usually results in a bulky governance framework. But Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools right?

So instead of imposing rules and regulations on people. Give them the support to make the right decisions and define robust standards. 

 It is fear, putting your head the chopping block and giving up control is hard. But it only feels like you are giving up control, in reality a leader/coacher/manager that supports their team can ensure they have everything that they need in order to be successful, be it funding, be it training or capability. Imposing rules and not giving the team support to meet them is the quickest way to lose confidence in the mission.


I don't come to work to do a bad job, sure I get paid to be here, but that doesn't mean I want to do the bare minimum to get my paycheck. I want to do something and I want to be proud of what I have done.

No one wants to come to work and fail.
