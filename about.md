description: A little more information about your favourite Jono...

I am Jono.

Web developer, game programmer, coffee addict...

I spend my days making small prototypes and junk, volunteering at my local codeclub and procrastinating.

**Like a Druid?**

<a href="http://druidjono.com">Yep</a>.

**Tutorials?**

I attempted this in the past when I started codeclub, but I feel that now after a year of it my mind is far more in tune with 10 years olds. Git was not the best place to start it may seem.

**Want to hire me?**

Too bad.
